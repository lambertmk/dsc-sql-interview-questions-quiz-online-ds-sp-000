    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "int, real, string/text, null. There's also blob, which I've never had to use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier in a table. This would not be shared by rows within that table. To use a real life example, a primary key would be a driver's license number. This doesn't always have to be \"usable\" - it could be an sequential integer used as an index.\n",
    "A foreign key is a piece of information shared between tables. These allow us to JOIN between tables. The \"foreign\" comes from that use; it allows us to \"connect\" the data between tables, and pull in based on that key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Data can be one to one, one to many or many to many. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "LEFT JOIN pulls all information from the left table and overlapping info from right\n",
    "JOIN/INNER JOIN pulls information that overlaps (key used for join is not null)\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN pulls all information from the right table, overlapping info from left\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN pulls all info from both tables, even where nulls are present\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Aggregate functions (like SUM, AVG) and GROUP BY statements are often used together for tidy, powerful analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Many to many JOINs can be overwhelming and hard to deal with; for that reason, creating a JOIN table is often easier. This third table is essentially a series of one to many relationships, where the information stored is determined by shared keys. \n",
    "Analyst example: rather than creating a dataframe with many values null, this join table allows us to only display lines where data is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
